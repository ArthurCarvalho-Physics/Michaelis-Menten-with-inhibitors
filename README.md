# Michaelis-Menten-with-inhibitors
We performed a study of Michaelis-Menten chemical kinetics with inhibitors using the Fock space approach. This methodology consists of rewriting the master equation as a Schr√∂dinger equation:
$$\frac{\partial \ket{\Psi(t)}}{\partial t} = -H(\alpha^\dagger_1,\alpha_1,...,\alpha^\dagger_k,\alpha_k)\ket{\Psi(t)},$$
with solution:
$$\ket{\Psi(t)} = \exp[-H(\alpha^\dagger_1,\alpha_1,...,\alpha^\dagger_k,\alpha_k)t]\ket{\Psi(0)},$$

The solution determines the probability of occurrence of each system configuration. The H factor is a quasi-Hamiltonian that is written in terms of second quantization operators. For Michaelis-Menten kinetics with inhibitor, H is:

$$H = k_{1+}(c^{\dagger}_1 - e^{\dagger} s^{\dagger})es$$

Each configuration is expressed in terms of kets and bra, in our code we use lists to represent these states, and we use an alternative representation of the quasi-Hamiltonian, writing it in terms of Kronecker deltas.

Our approach allowed us to determine the average quantity of substances as a function of time t, the time of first formation of product P, the reaction rate and the Lineweaver-Burk linearization. The refer to these results.
